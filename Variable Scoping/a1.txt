Variable Scoping

1. What is the scope of num, square, input_num, result? 
Ans: num - Local Scope (inside num_square function), square - Local Scope input_num - Global Scope result - Global Scope

2. What is the lifetime of each variable? When will they be created and destroyed? 
Ans: num - created when function num_square gets executed and destroyed when the function execution is completed. square - created when function num_square gets executed and destroyed when the function execution is completed. input_num - created when the program execution begins and destroyed when program execution is completed result - It's creation depends on the result of if and once created it would be destroyed after the program execution

3. What would happen if input_num had a value of less than 100? 
Ans: result variable would never be created and the print statement would raise a NameError as no variable with the name variable is created

4. What would be the scope and value of result if input_num has a value of less than 100? 
Ans: local scope and it would not have a value since it was never created(so null probably).
